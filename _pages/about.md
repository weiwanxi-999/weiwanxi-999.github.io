So,if i have nothing notable to show,i just post something to share.👇

I belonged to no one who belonged to everyone<br>Who had nothing,who wanted everything<br>with a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom<br>That terrified me to the point<br>That I couldn’t even talk about it<br>And pushed me to a nomadic point of madness<br>That both dazzled and dizzied me
