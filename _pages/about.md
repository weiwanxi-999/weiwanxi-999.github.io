Wei Wanxi, born in January 2000 in Chongqing, China. Graduated with a bachelor's degree in Journalism from [Xiangtan University](https://wxy.xtu.edu.cn/), where I received systematic training in journalism and communication. Currently, I am a graduate student in the [school of Journalism and Communication, Nanjing University](https://jc.nju.edu.cn/) and a member of [Cheng-jun Wang](https://chengjunwang.com/)'s [Computational Communication Collaboratory,](https://socrateslab.github.io/en/). At present, I am embarking on a cross-disciplinary journey of knowledge exploration, transitioning from writing, editing, and reviewing in the humanities and social sciences to data analysis in computational communication. I am fully embracing every challenge and moment of growth along this journey.

<br>
Here, I would like to share some reflections from my spiritual icon with everyone.ðŸ‘‡

I belonged to no one who belonged to everyone<br>Who had nothing,who wanted everything<br>with a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom<br>That terrified me to the point<br>That I couldnâ€™t even talk about it<br>And pushed me to a nomadic point of madness<br>That both dazzled and dizzied me
